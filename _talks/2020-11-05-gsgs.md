## Abstract of the poster :

Simulations play a crucial role to investigate hazardous situations that are impossible to test in real-life conditions
without endangering the user’s safety. This paper presents a simulator of conditionally automated
cars aiming at enhancing the driver safety and driving comfort. In addition, thanks to the simulator’s highly
repeatability, integrated sensors and controlled conditions we collected valuable scientific data, which is
otherwise very difficult to gather.
