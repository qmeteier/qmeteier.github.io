## Abstract :
Takeover requests in conditionally automated vehicles are a critical point in time that can lead to accidents, and as such should be transmitted with care. Currently, several studies have shown the impact of using different modalities for different psychophysiological states, but no model exists to predict the takeover quality depending on the psychophysiological state of the driver and takeover request modalities. In this paper, we propose a machine learning model able to predict the maximum steering wheel angle and the reaction time of the driver, two takeover quality metrics. Our model is able to achieve a gain of 42.26% on the reaction time and 8.92% on the maximum steering wheel angle compared to our baseline. This was achieved using up to 150 s of psychophysiological data prior to the takeover. Impacts of using such a model to choose takeover modalities instead of using standard takeover requests should be investigated.
