Project details 
======
* 2 students to supervise.
* Students worked 4 hours per week for 5 months.
* 1 meeting per week.


Context of the project 
======

To date, technological advances have made it possible to automate vehicles. For example, a level 2 automated car offers partial autonomy, i.e. the system can manage the acceleration, deceleration and steering of a vehicle thanks to the information perceived by various vehicle sensors. However, vehicle automation still causes road accidents during testing. This is why the HumanTech Institute, in collaboration with He-Arc and the University of Freiburg, has launched the "Ad Vitam" project to study critical situations (called limitations) that could endanger the users of an automated car. Based on a litterature review, critical situations for automated cars were identified. It includes narrow and winding road, bad weather conditions, slippery and wet roads, and many more. Thus, driving scenarios are required with the intention of studying these risk situations in the simulator. Therefore, the goal of the DriveSim project is to design a driving scenario in a 3D engine (Unity) containing challenging stuations for the car. The scenario will be then used by the project team to perform user tests in the driving simulator.


Tasks done by the student
======

* Implementation of 5 critical situations (e.g. limitations) from the initial urban scenario :
	* a ball crossing the road
	* a cyclist in the left lane
	* a construction zone
	* road markings damaged
	* a pedestrian crossing the road
* Implementation of the car autopilot in the city :
	* path of the car in the city
	* traffic lights management
	* traffic management (braking or accelerating depending on traffic)
* Test of the implemented scenario on the driving scenario with few users
* Evaluation the realism and dangerousness of the elements integrated in the scenario, based on user ratings
