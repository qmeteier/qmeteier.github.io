* 1 student to supervise (remotely).
* The student worked full-time for 3 months.


Context of the project 
======

The goal of this project is to investigate if carrying a passenger while driving has an effect on driver's physiological arousal and how accurate machine learning algorithms can be to recognize such condition. Another research question adressed in this study is to investigate the effect of relaxtion prior driving as a mean to reduce the stress experience and if can also be classified with such algorithms.


Tasks done by the student
======

* Self-learning of Machine Learning concepts using online tutorials
* Handling of existing code in Python (to generate features and perform classification tasks)
* Implementation of new functionnalities to the code
	* Implementation of two classifiers : Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors
	* Generation of features for different lengths of time windows
	* Generation of graphs to display the evolution of feature values over time
* Running classification tasks and generation of graphs showing classifiers accuracy
* Redaction of final report
* Presentation of results to the institute
