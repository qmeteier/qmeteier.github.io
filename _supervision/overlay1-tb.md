* 1 student to supervise.
* The student worked full-time for 3 months.
* Approximately 1 meeting per month.


Context of the project 
======

To date, technological advances have made it possible to automate vehicles. For example, a level 2 automated car offers partial autonomy, i.e. the system can manage the acceleration, deceleration and steering of a vehicle thanks to the information perceived by various vehicle sensors. However, vehicle automation still causes road accidents during testing. This is why the HumanTech Institute, in collaboration with He-Arc and the University of Freiburg, has launched the "Ad Vitam" project to explore new concepts of Human-Vehicle interaction to maintain driver's situation awareness and make future driving safer. The goal of the Overlay project is to create is an Android mobile application allowing a driver in an automated car todo a Non-Driving-Related task on a tablet while receiving information about the car's environement. The goal was to build a first prototype of the application.



Tasks done by the student
======

* State of the art of possible technologies : split-screen, transparent layout, services, picture in picture, notifications
* Identifying the information that need to be conveyed to the driver
* Design of the data structure format for sending information from the simulator to the tablet : frame in JSON format
* Mock-up of the application design
	* global design
	* modules
	* icons
* Conception of the mobile application : class diagram
* Implementaton of the mobile application in Java (Android Studio)
	* global design
	* resources management : images and audio
	* receiving data from the driving simulator
* Evaluation of the application
	* Functional tests
	* User tests : Evaluation of the efficiency the elements integrated in the scenario, based on user ratings
