Context of the project 
======

The goal of this project is to investigate the effect of sleep-deprivation and driving environment on situation awareness, trust and physiological state of drivers. The data were collected on a fixed-based driving simulator where participants had to drive in conditional automation for 50 minutes. Half of them were sleep-deprived the night before the experiment (20% less compared to theirs sleep habits). Besides, all participants experienced two different diving scenarios : 1 in the counstryside and 1 in the city. They had to react accordingly to 2 Takeover Requests (TORs), one in each scenario


Tasks done by the students
======

* Design of the experiment (procedure and choice of task and measures)
* Preparation of the material for user testing : questionnaires, instructions, audio recorder
* User testing : data collection of 90 participants
	* Socio-demographic questions
	* Physiological signals : ECG, EDA and Respiration
	* Alertness level : Karolinska Sleepiness Scale
	* Performance of vigilence task
	* Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART)
	* Situational Trust (STS-AD)
	* Affective State (AniSAM)
	* User Experience (UEQ-S)
* Data analysis
* Realization of the bachelor thesis
* Optional : Creation of a poster summarizing the work done
