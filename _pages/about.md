My name is Quentin Meteier and I'm currently a PhD student in computer science at the University of Fribourg. The main topic of my PhD is to build a psychophysiological model of the driver in vehicles, and more specifically for drivers of semi-autonomous vehicles.

I am also a scientific collaborator at the HumanTech Institute, where I mainly work on the [AdVitam project](http://advitam.humantech.institute/). AdVitam stands for Adaptive Driver-Vehicule InTerAction to Make future driving safer. It is a 4 years (2018-2022) research project co-funded by Hasler Fundation. This project involves three PhD students and my work aims at investigating how we can use several psychophysiological signals to build a model to assess the driver state in real-time.

The goal is to assess the driver's physiological state with regard to 4 components : fatigue, stress, cognitive load and situation awareness.

3 experiments were conducted on a fixed-base driving simulator. Physiological signals suchs as electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration were collected while participants drove in conditional automation and performed various Non-Driving-Related Tasks (NDRTs). The collected data were filtered and processed. Features are created from physiological indicators and a model is trained using machine learning techniques to classify the driver's state. The ultimate goal is to evaluate the driver's state in real-time using embedded sensors in the driving simulator.
