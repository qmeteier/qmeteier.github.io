My name is Quentin Meteier and I'm currently a PhD student in computer science at the University of Fribourg. The main topic of my PhD is to build a psychophysiological model of the driver in vehicles, and more specifically for drivers of semi-autonomous vehicles.

I am also a scientific collaborator at the HumanTech Institute, where I mainly work on the AdVitam project [AdVitam website] (http://advitam.humantech.institute/). AdVitam stands for Adaptive Driver-Vehicule InTerAction to Make future driving safer. It is a 3 years (2018-2021) research project co-funded by Hasler Fundation. This project involves three PhD students and my work aims at investigating how we can use several psychophysiological signals to build a model to assess the driver state in real-time.
